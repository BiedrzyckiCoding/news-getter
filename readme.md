this is supposed to be a simple app that fetches historical data from google using google custom search api

the purpse of this repo is to then use this program to retrirve historial data about companies / crypto to try and find a correlation between the news and their price movements

as far as im aware, the api fetches links to the web articles, then i can build a simple webscraper to scrape the html contents and retrire text from it - make embeddings using a simple library, maybe it will privide better data.
